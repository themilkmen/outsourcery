# Layering IT Management Processes: Why it's Essential for Your Business

In today's business environment, technology plays a critical role in virtually every aspect of an organization's operations. IT management processes, therefore, are essential to ensure that technology is used efficiently and effectively to meet business objectives. One approach to achieving this is to layer IT management processes. This article explains why layering IT management processes is important, outlines some examples of layers, and provides a few do's and don'ts for business owners who may not be technical.

## Why is layering IT management processes important?

Layering IT management processes is important for several reasons. First, it helps to ensure that different aspects of IT management are considered and addressed. For example, IT policies may dictate what kind of software is allowed on company devices, while training can ensure that employees know how to use that software correctly. Second, layering helps to ensure that there are multiple lines of defence against IT threats, such as cyber-attacks or data breaches. Finally, layering IT management processes can help to reduce the risk of errors or omissions that could impact business operations.

## Examples of layers in IT management processes

There are many different layers that can be employed in IT management processes. Here are a few examples:

1. IT policies: IT policies are rules and guidelines that govern the use of technology in an organization. Examples might include policies around acceptable use of company devices, password requirements, or data security.

2. Software: Software can be used to automate IT management tasks, such as antivirus software to protect against malware, or inventory management software to keep track of company devices.

3. Training: Training can help ensure that employees understand how to use technology correctly and can help prevent errors or omissions. Examples of training might include cybersecurity awareness training or training on how to use a new software program.

4. Auditing: Auditing can help identify areas of weakness in IT management processes and ensure that policies and procedures are being followed. Auditing can also help to ensure that any IT security breaches are identified quickly and dealt with appropriately.

5. Backup and recovery: Backup and recovery processes are critical to ensure that data can be restored in the event of a disaster or data breach. Regular backups and testing of recovery procedures are essential to ensure that data can be restored quickly and with minimal impact on business operations.

## Do's and Don'ts for Business Owners

Here are a few do's and don'ts for business owners who may not be technical, but who want to ensure that their IT management processes are effective:

### Do:

1. Consult with an MSP: Managed Service Providers (MSPs) can provide expert guidance and support for IT management processes. They can help to identify areas of weakness and provide recommendations for improvement.

2. Develop IT policies: IT policies can help to ensure that technology is used in a way that supports business objectives and reduces the risk of errors or omissions.

3. Invest in training: Training can help to ensure that employees know how to use technology correctly and can help prevent errors or omissions.

4. Regularly review IT management processes: Regular reviews can help to identify areas of weakness and ensure that policies and procedures are being followed.

### Don't:

1. Assume that IT management is someone else's responsibility: As a business owner, IT management is ultimately your responsibility. It's important to take an active role in ensuring that IT management processes are effective.

2. Neglect backups and recovery: Backup and recovery processes are critical to ensure that data can be restored in the event of a disaster or data breach. Regular backups and testing of recovery procedures are essential.

3. Neglect IT security: Cybersecurity threats are an ever-present danger in today's business environment. It's important to invest in IT security measures, such as antivirus software, firewalls, and employee training, to reduce the risk of cyber-attacks and data breaches.

4. Rely solely on one layer of IT management: While each layer of IT management is important, relying solely on one layer can leave your business vulnerable. For example, having strong IT policies is important, but without regular training and auditing, employees may not follow those policies correctly.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, layering IT management processes is essential for any business that uses technology to support its operations. IT policies, software, training, auditing, and backup and recovery are just a few examples of layers that can be employed to ensure effective IT management. By following the do's and don'ts outlined above, business owners can help to ensure that their IT management processes are effective and provide the necessary level of protection against cyber threats and data breaches. While some aspects of IT management may benefit from the expertise of an MSP, it is ultimately the business owner's responsibility to ensure that IT management processes are effective and aligned with business objectives.
