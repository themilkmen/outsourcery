# Why controlling administrative access to your work computers can save you time, money and a lot of pain

## Introduction

As a Managed Service Provider (MSP), our primary goal is to help businesses maximise their IT investments and ensure optimal security. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is by restricting local administrator rights for team members. While it may seem counterintuitive, limiting these privileges can actually improve overall security and efficiency. In this article, we'll delve into the benefits of restricting local administrator rights and provide a few suggestions for managing this effectively in a small company, ultimately highlighting the importance of partnering with an MSP.

## Benefits of Restricting Local Administrator Rights

### 1. Enhanced Security

Restricting local administrator rights significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised software installations, malicious activity, and system configuration changes. This helps to protect your company from malware, ransomware, and other cyber threats. By limiting administrator privileges to a select few, you can ensure that only trusted individuals have the ability to make significant changes to your systems.

### 2. Improved System Stability

When users have local administrator rights, they may inadvertently or intentionally change system settings or install applications that can compromise the overall stability of the system. By restricting these rights, you can maintain a more consistent and stable computing environment, which in turn minimises downtime and improves productivity.

### 3. Regulatory Compliance

Many regulatory standards, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, require organisations to implement strong access controls to protect sensitive data. Limiting local administrator rights is an effective way to meet these requirements and demonstrate compliance to auditors.

### 4. Streamlined Software Management

By restricting local administrator rights, you can standardise the software installed on company devices, making it easier to manage updates, patches, and licensing. This not only reduces the risk of software-related issues but also saves time and resources.

### 5. Reduced IT Support Costs

When users have local administrator rights, they may attempt to resolve issues themselves, often making the problem worse. By limiting these privileges, you can ensure that IT support staff handle all issues, which leads to faster resolution times and reduced support costs.

## Tips for Managing Local Administrator Rights in Small Companies

### 1. Establish a Centralised IT Administration

To effectively manage local administrator rights, you need to centralise your IT administration. This involves creating a dedicated team responsible for managing user accounts, installing software, and addressing support requests. By consolidating these tasks, you can maintain better control over your systems and reduce the risk of unauthorised access.

### 2. Implement a Least Privilege Policy

A least privilege policy ensures that users have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions. This means that most users will have limited permissions, with only a select few having local administrator rights. This policy not only improves security but also encourages employees to escalate issues to the appropriate IT staff.

### 3. Use Group Policy and Active Directory

Microsoft's Group Policy and Active Directory tools can help you manage local administrator rights across your network. These tools allow you to define user access levels and permissions, making it easy to control who has local administrator rights and to apply changes consistently across the entire organisation.

### 4. Provide Regular Security Training

To minimise the risk of security incidents, it's essential to provide regular security training for your team. This should include guidance on best practices for handling sensitive data, the dangers of installing unauthorised software, and the importance of promptly reporting any security concerns.

## The Role of MSPs in Managing Local Administrator Rights

While the tips provided above can help small companies manage local administrator rights effectively, partnering with an MSP can offer additional benefits. An MSP can not only help implement these best practices but also provide ongoing support,
